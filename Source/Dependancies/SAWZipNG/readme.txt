SAWZipNG
--------

SAWZipNG is the new version of the SAWZip control. It is totally rewritten, because now
it uses the ZipArchive_STL library from artpol-software (www.artpol-software.com)

This means also that the object interfaces are not compatible anymore with the previous
versions :( So you have to rewrite the zip code in your Visual Basic program.
