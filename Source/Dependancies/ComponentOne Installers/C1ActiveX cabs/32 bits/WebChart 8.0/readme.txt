ComponentOne WebChart 8.0 Build              27 July 2004
===================================================================================

What's New
----------

General: (includes bug fixes)

  - HMTL help is now used by the both the 2D and 3D Charts.

  - Time axes in the 2D Chart now support time values from
    Dec 31, 1899 to Dec 31, 2099.  New DLL APIs for the 2D Chart
    are also available.

  - A licensing problem with unicode evaluation versions has been
    fixed.

  - Property page dialogs now add extensions to saved filenames when an
    extension is not provided.

  - Chart 2D RotationConstant enums oc2dRotate45Degrees and
    oc2dRotate315Degrees have been removed.  These values had no
    effect for any object property that may have used them.  To rotate
    axis annotations, use the Axis AnnotationRotationAngle property,
    which accepts any angle.

  - 2D Chart FillStyle property pages now include both foreground and
    background colors, thus allowing the fill color (foreground) and the
    pattern color (background).  This combination has always been
    available through code.

  - Axis plane lines for 2D Charts with 3D effects are controlled by
    PlotArea boxing.  In the past, some of the lines were controlled by
    ChartArea Outlines.

  - 2D Chart Axis ValueLabels now contain a Color property.  ValueLabels are
    created with the default or automatic color.

  - TrueType fonts are now correctly generated for axes in the Unicode
    Charts.

  - 3D Chart Preview mode now repaints images as the preview cube rotates.
    In previous versions, parts of the image could be erased.

  - Corrected problem with 3D surface chart when RowCount=1 or ColumnCount=1.
    Operations no longer cause an exception.

  - Corrected problem with 3D contour chart when there is only one contour level.
    Operations no longer cause an exception.

  - 3D chart label embedded images now load correctly.

  - 3D chart label font size can be modified through property page
    when Attach Method set to Coordinates.

  - 3D Chart legend colors now display correctly when LabelFilter is not 1.

  - 3D Chart ChartGroup RowLabels and ColumnLabels and Legend Labels can now be
    indexed by their text value as well as their numericial index.

  - Property pages now reflect changes in other property pages.  In the past
    this did not always occur.

  - 2D Chart interactive scaling no longer locks at a point, and maintains
    the original X-Y aspect ratio for cartesian styled charts.

  - 2D Chart alarm zones added to the collection, before existing items, are
    now brushed onto the chart PlotArea in the correct order.  This was only
    an issue if the alarm zones overlapped.

  - 2D Chart HiLoOpenClose plots now correctly display the HiLoOpenClose
    indicators when printing.

  - 2D Chart PrintChart now prints circular charts with uniform scaling and
    centers the chart in the specified rectangle when oc2ScaleToMax is used
    for the scaling parameter.  Previously, Pie, Polar, Radar and Filled
    Radar charts could be scaled non-uniformly resulting in skewed circular
    regions.

  - Problems associated with an IME editor in Unicode Charts property pages
    have been corrected.

  - Chart2D labels with negative offsets no longer draw connecting lines
    through the label.

  - Chart2D plots with 3D effects now display lines at the axis plane
    intersections when shading is not turned on.

  - 3D chart corrected default value for the cube font size.
    In the past, it was set to 1 when incorrect value was entered.
    Now default value always is 80.	

  - 3D chart number of contour level now returns to default after
    Reset() method.

  - Corrected problem for 2D radar chart with axis gridline spacing
    in property page.

  - 2D Chart imporoved rendering of styled(dotted, dashed) lines
    for Win9x.

  - 2D Chart and 3D Chart now supports automatic axis gridline color.

  - 3D Chart default gridline color was changed to automatic.
  
  - 2D and 3D Chart DataPath properties of the main chart objects can
    now be cleared at design time.  Invalid URL's no longer cause GPFs.

  - Corrected label rectangle postioning for 2D chart
    when the label text is rotated.

  - Corrected 3D Chart problems when allocating large data arrays
    with regular or irregular data layout. Now chart generates error
    when data does not fit to the available memory.

  - 2D UNICODE chart now correctly formats DBCS characters for
    timelabels.

  - 3D Chart contour loading with LoadURL and Load now perform more strict
    format checking, so invalid files are not loaded and data modified.

  - 2D Chart now automatically switches to scientific notation for axes
    annotations when appropriate.

  - 2D chart simple candle charts now renedered with hollow candle
    when open was higher than close.

  - 3D chart contour lines are not rendered when its width is 0
    or pattern is none. In the past these lines were rendered
    using default style.

  - 3D chart now correctly adjusts value for linestyle width of
    ChartStyle object. Possible values for the width are from 0 to 100.

  - 2D chart PointLabels and SeriesLabels are immutable when bound.

  - 3D chart axis titles and annotations now are rendered correctly
    when perspective is close to 1.

  - 3D chart plotcube XScale and YScale properties now have permissible 
    range from 1 to 10000(measured in percents).

  - Corrected the problems with incorrect 3D chart preview rendering under
    several conditions.

  - 2D chart databinding through the property page Binding tab is better
    behaved.

  - 3D chart now correctly loads with non-default view scale.

  - 2D Chart SeriesDisplay value has been retyped to DisplayConstant from
    short.  In the VB environment, this allows code completion to identify
    the appropriate constant by name.  However, this change to the typelib
    will require a either a cast or use of the DisplayConstant values for
    the next recompile of programs which use the get_SeriesDisplay() and
    put_SeriesDisplay() methods of the dual interface.  Please note change
    will only affect programs which use the dual interface directly - most
    typically those that perform #import operations of the chart typelib.

  - Fixed 2D chart problem that caused 3d XY Plots and 3d Area Charts to
    report the wrong data index from CoordToDataIndex() calls when the data
    contained hole values.

  - Fixed 2D chart problem in which ChartLabel images were not properly
    clipped.

  - Corrected behavior of 2D and 3D charts when data object IsSaved property
    is set to false.

  - Chart 2D and 3D temporary files created by the LoadURL() method of data
    objects are now properly deleted even when the data files were not of the
    correct format.

  - Chart 2D and 3D DrawToFile() operations now correctly return FALSE and
    close and delete partial files for all formats.

  - Chart 2D annotations now correctly trim trailing zeros from all floating
    point values using custom formats with placeholders.

  - Chart3D contour level linestyles are correctly identified in the legend
    for both filtered and unfiltered legend labels.

  - Chart2D now increases the default precision for percentage formats by 2.
    The new precision is more appropriate for percentage formats.

  - Chart2D no longer leaks GDI fonts associated with rotated ChartLabels.

  - Chart2D processes X axis date values more efficiently than before.

  - Chart2D automatic X axis minimum and maximum values are now calculated
    differently for TimeLabels and TimeLabelsEvent.  The new calculation
    is better at insuring that an annotation appears at the mininum and
    maximum locations on the X axis.

  - Embedded images could not be saved prior to the first render of the
    chart after setting the image.  This has been changed so embedded
    images can be saved.

  - Fixed a memory leak associated with PNG byte arrays.

  - About box no longer incorrectly indicates an evaluation license when a valid
    license is present.

  - Loading of Chart2D series related styles have undergone optimization changes.
    Saved 2D charts (oc2 files) with many series will now load faster.

Properties:

  - Legend.IsShowing3DShading property.  When True (default) the legend
    shows 2 or 3 colors for each series as appropriate for plots with
    3D effects that have shading.  When False, only the color indicated
    by the series style is shown.  The property has also been added to
    the Legend-General property page.  For an example of the new property,
    see the Visual Basic 2D Chart demos, ChLabels. (2D Chart only)

  - Chart.PropertyPageHelpfile property.  This property can be used to set
    the path of the property page help file used at runtime.  Thus Chart
    programmers can now customize the property page help as appropriate
    for their customers.   Context IDs and sample help file projects will
    be supplied. The use of HTML help or WinHelp is determined by the
    extension of the file specified. (2D and 3D Charts)

  - The AxisIDConstants enumeration values now match the Axes
    collection elements. (2D and 3D Charts)

  - Axis.AnnotationPosition property. This property controls
    position of axis annotation and title for the 3D Chart.
    (3D Chart only)

  - CBorder property has been added to the 2D and 3D Chart objects.  This
    property refers to exactly the same object as the Border property.  It
    has been added to provide an alternate name to the Border object, as
    some browsers (IE 6.x for example) do not allow ActiveX objects use
    Border as a property name. (2D and 3D Charts)

  - 2D Chart Axis ValueLabels now contain a Color property.  ValueLabels are
    created with the default or automatic color.

  - 2D Chart ChartArea Candle now contains an IsFillFalling property.  This
    property determines whether rising or falling candles are filled.

Methods:

  - Chart.Reset() method.  The Reset method returns the chart instance to
    its default state.  A Reset button was also added to the Control-General
    property page. (2D and 3D Charts)

  - New Chart methods were added that allow the creation of image data in
    a byte array.  These new methods facilitate image transfer in webchart
    without the use of files. The new methods include SaveImageAsJpegBytes(),
    SaveImageAsPngBytes() and SaveImageAsDibBytes().  Primarily for WebChart
    use, check out the new methods in the latest version of
    ComponentOne WebChart 8.0. (2D and 3D Charts)

  - New ChartEditorElements for the Control-General property page controls.
    Each button and and checkbox on the Control-General property page
    can now be shown or hidden at runtime as desired.  The new elements
    appear in the ChartEditorElementContants enumeration and can be used
    with both Chart methods, ShowChartEditorElement() and
    IsChartEditorElementVisible().   (2D and 3D Charts)

  - New statistic methods have been added to the 2D chart data object.  The
    new methods include Mean(), Median(), StandardDeviation(),
    AverageDeviation().  Supplementary to these methods, addition methods
    are provided to ease addition statistical calculations, including
    DataCount(), DataMax() and DataMin().  These latter methods operate
    only with those data points that do not contain data holes.  Each method
    operates on a single series, or on all series within the ChartGroup.
    (2D Chart only).

  - New data methods have been added to the 2D chart data object.  The new
    methods can be used to generate and evaluate polynomials based on series
    data or supplied data.  The new OCX Data object methods include
    SeriesPolynomial(), DataPolynomial() and EvaluatePolynomial().  Similar
    functions are available for the DLL Chart API as well.

Events:

  - FormatAxisAnno() event.  This event is fired whenever an annotation
    value needs to be formatted for an axis with the Axis.AnnotationMethod
    property is set to either ValuesEvent or TimeLabelsEvent (new options).
    The event passes the AxisID index, the Value and the default Label text
    for each annotation value.  The Label text can then be modified as desired
    prior to display.  (2D Chart only)
