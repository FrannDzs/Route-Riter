Notes:

1) There are seven main vehicle categories, some with subtypes;
   locomotive, steam engine, railcar, passenger car, freight car, high-speed train, and maglev.

2) The types of bearings applicable to each car type are marked with an "X".
   The types are roller(R), low-torque roller(L), and friction(F).
   Bearing types are not applicable for high-speed trains or maglevs because only
   one set of equations is used for each (maglevs obviously don't have bearings or axles).

3) There are seven different data fields;
   speed, mass, number of axles, area, drag coefficient, length and weight on drivers.
   No type of rolling stock uses all values, the applicable ones are marked with an "X".

4) The units used for input in data fields can be selected to be either US or Metric.

5) There is also custom calculation fields where you can input Davis coefficients (in either
   US or Metric) directly along with a speed range and get an appropriate MSTS friction value.
