Features available of various support Martin Wright DLLs in their own programs.


These DLLs provide functions for reading and writing most common image formats (and a number of uncommon ones as well) and for performing many functions on images. What makes them a bit different from more "normal" image libraries is the support for many game-related image formats largely unsupported elsewhere.

The packages consist of general documentation in PDF format, support files for various programming languages and example source files that demonstrate how to use the functions from within your programs.

Files:

mwgfx.dll

Documentation and files to allow the access of mwgfx functions from programs. Functions for reading and writing most graphics formats. Functions for simple image processing. Functions to call up Dialogs for Printing, Processing and Displaying images. Examples for Borland C++Builder, VC++, Delphi and Visual Basic.

mwdds.dll

Documentation and files to allow direct access to the functions in mwdds.dll (currently only accessible 2nd hand through mwgfx.dll functions). mwdds.dll provides functions for reading and writing DDS, Extended Bmp and other DXT formats.

mwace.dll

Documentation and files to allow the access of mwace functions from programs. Mwace is a DLL that encapsulates the functions used in TgaTool2 so they can be used by any program for the conversion of Trainsim ACE image files to a more editable format. Examples for Borland C++Builder, VC++, Delphi and Visual Basic.
